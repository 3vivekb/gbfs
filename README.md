# General Bikeshare Feed Specification

Documentation for the General Bikeshare Feed Specification, a standardized data feed for bike share system availability.

## What is GBFS?

General Bikeshare Feed Specification, known as GBFS, is the open data standard for bikeshare. GBFS will make real-time data feeds publicly available online in a uniform format so that map and transportation based apps can easily incorporate this data into their platforms.

Under the North American Bikeshare Associationâ€™s leadership, bikeshare industry leaders including 8D Technologies, PBSC Urban Solutions, Social Bicycles, BCycle, Smoove, and Motivate developed the GBFS over the past year. All have agreed to implement the standard by the end of 2015.
